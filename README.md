## Python Setup Script

### Descriptions
Downloads programs defined in the common.json file, then runs the setup files to speed up the process of remembering what programs you had installed and where to find them. As of now they are pointing towards the Windows executables, however, I plan on implementing Mac OSX support as well.


### TODO
* Implement Mac OSX Support, .dmg etc.
* Fix other executable files, like .msi etc.
* Implement support for .zip files and structures where the executable is in a folder.
* Implement DWS for Windows, (Destroy Windows Spying)
If you have any suggestions you are welcome to commit them to this repository or message me.
